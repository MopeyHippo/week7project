 ** Remember to create 2 folders in your project root. One named "server" and one named "client". **

🎯 Design a database schema with relationships between tables

🎯 Create a new application with a React client and an Express server
(again, remember the client and the server should be separate)

🎯 Seed the database with data. Either run your SQL queries in Supabase SQL Editor OR use a seed.js file. (if you use the Supabase editor, save the scripts you run in a file in your project, in case you need to rerun them, or we need to duplicate the project)

🎯 Create Express endpoints to handle requests so you can POST and GET the data appropriately for your application.

🎯 Create multiple pages using react-router-dom

🎯 Create a home page.
🎯 Create a page to show all the posts and use fetch to call your server to get your data.
🎯 Create a page where users can create new posts using a form.

🏹 Allow users to "Like" posts and increase the likes

🏹 Allow users to DELETE posts

🏹 Allow users to filter posts in a specific category. Use either a query string like /posts?category=education or a dedicated route for the categories at /posts/:categoryName.
